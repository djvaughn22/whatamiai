# WhatAmIAI (whatamiai.com)
Secular self-reflection: 7 quick questions → reflection prompt for any AI. Accent: **#E879F9**.
- The copy-to-AI prompt asks for "timeless, proverb-style wisdom … practical, not preachy" — keep that line (wise, gospel-pleasing, never labeled).
- No labels/boxes for the user; bridges to CrossHeartPray for the faith version.

## Open Mirror family rules
- One of 11 Open Mirror LLC sites (hub: openmirrorllc.com, repo djvaughn22/open-mirror). Baseline tag: `mvp-1`.
- **Design:** flat + cool. bg `#0b1220`, surface `#141d2e`, border `#26324c`, text `#e8edf5`, muted `#94a3b8`. No glass, no gradients, **no red**.
- **Shared chrome is SYNCED, not owned here:** `OpenMirrorNav.tsx`, `OpenMirrorFooter.tsx`, `OpenMirrorTheme.tsx` in the app folder are copies from the hub repo `packages/openmirror-ui/`. NEVER edit them here — edit in the hub, run its `scripts/sync-ui.sh`, then rebuild/commit each satellite.
- Nav + footer mount in `layout.tsx`. Footer = OPEN MIRROR LLC · ABOUT · ✝️ ❤️ 🙏 (the icons ARE the CrossHeartPray link — no word).
- ☀️/🌙 family toggle (`om-theme`) lives in the bar; pages that compute JS colors follow the `om-theme` window event.
- **Copy style:** DJ's words. Short, plain, human. Never wordy or AI-sounding.
- **Deploys:** push to `main` = production deploy (Vercel). Batch related edits into one commit.
